This is my first file of GIT.
Today I learnt to set user name and Email with git config --global user.name or user.email.

And something more:

1) Add SSH RSA on github by setting.
2) PUSH local master to github. By git remote add origin git@github.com:techch3/learn.git
3) git commit
4) CLONE github to local master. By git clone git@github.com:techch3/hello.git
